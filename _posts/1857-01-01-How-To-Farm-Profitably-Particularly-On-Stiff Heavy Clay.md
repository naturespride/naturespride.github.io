# How to farm profitably particularly on stiff heavy clay
# by MR. SHERIFF MECHI
>"The progress of Agriculture ought to be one of the objects of our constant care; for upon its improvement or its neglect depends the prosperity or the decline of empires." - From the French Emperor's Speech on opening the Legislature, 16th February , 1857 
 
ALTHOUGH I shall prove in these pages unmistakeably and undeniably,by practical facts arithmetically and mathematically true, that numerous profitable things may be done in agriculture, I have no expectation that the bulk or generality of either landlords or tenants will practise them. The history of prejudice has always been the same, viz. : resistance to
innovation and disbelief of progress, but that is no justification of despair; on the contrary, all the evidence of time shows that we must fight manfully against the old enemy, and over come him by degrees.

We have hope to cheer us on, for can we forget that in our own time gas was pronounced impossible, steam vessels would
never cross an ocean?

Our Legislative Committees considered Stephenson's Express Train an insane dream, and still we hold converse
through earth and water at lightning speed, defying time and distance.

That our lands might support all our population without foreign aid is not with me a matter of doubt, seeing by my own farm, as well as many others, practical illustrations of the fact. It is a common matter of figures. But I have no expectation that it will be done. Still, if my exertions in the cause of agricultural progression make some impression on agricultural lethargy and disbelief, my object will have been accomplished.

I have often been much amused by the compassionating look and manner in which my friends enquired after my doings
at Tiptree.

The translation of those sentiments is this — 
>“ Mr. Mechi,you are kindly losing money by your experiments to oblige the country, and we ought to be grateful to you ." 

But when I sternly ejaculate that whatever does not pay in agriculture is not an improvement, and when I demand categorical answers to these questions:

* Does drainage pay ?
* Does deeper cultivation pay ?
* Does economy ofmanure pay ?
* Does efficient shelter for stock pay ?
* Do large , well squared fields, good roads, and good buildings pay ?
* Do ample manuring and more cleanly cultivation pay ?
* Does a larger employment of labour pay ?
* Does the employment of steam -power, improved machinery,implements, & c., pay ?

I soon find how shallow and groundless are the objections to agricultural improvement.

The fact is, that for several years I have been deriving a most gratifying return for my expenditure, and it is of a very
enduring and continuous character , but the world does not believe it.

In agriculture, as in other matters, you must invest & capital before you can get an interest or profit.

Whilst I am musing on the ignorance and prejudice that loses so many pounds per acre to the wretched tiller of undrained clays, I have no doubt that many such a man is chuckling at his own supposed pre-eminence, and congratulating himself that he does not throw away his money like that Mr. Mechi.

Very odd impressions about me exist in some of the retired local districts.

A friend from Northampton happened to say on his return, that he had been to visit me at Tiptree, but the farmer whom he addressed shook his head, and said that could not be, for that he (Mr. Mechi) had broke, and run away a long while ago.

If we wished EVIDENCE OF THE BACKWARDNESS OF AGRICULTURE, we have only to refer to its own pet publications. Take, for instance, the Mark Lane Express, the farmer's own paper, which has all along "patted on the back" the practical man, and "snubbed" what it calls the "subtle scientifics."

Annexed is a portion of its leading article of this day. It is too true :

>“Upon a careful investigation , we safely assert that 20 per cent. of ordinary farm - yard manure is wasted . An examination of ten farm homesteads consecutively taken has fully established this supposition . In six of these the whole of the water from the roofs of the buildings fell directly into the yards. In two instances the buildings were supplied partially with water-shoots , but these were in such imperfect order as to be nearly useless ; and in neither of the other two cases did they effectually answer the purpose forwhich they had been putup. Where the yards were of large dimensions,pools of liquid manure were found standing full to the edge, and which, after becoming filled, ran over into the nearest pond or ditch in a continuous stream of black liquid. No attempt had ever been made to carry it away in that state - no tanks having been formed for its reception.
“In most instances sufficient litter was at hand to render the yards tolerably comfortable for the cattle, although in rainy seasons this appeared almost impossible : so that the manure became subjected to continuous wastings for weeks together. 
“It is too much the fashion to look abroad for improvements, and forget that the first necessity for them exists at home. Year after year passes away regardless of consequences, and thus manure sufficient for the annual supply
of the farm is lost once in every five years, and in some instances in a far less space of time. It has ever been thus, and will probably continue to be so, unless tenants can be awakened to the importance of the question ; and this,
if left to themselves to correct, would probably even then never take place. Whenever this subject has been individually adverted to , the answer is invariably , My landlord will not do anything . The same observation applies to the improvement of buildings , to drainage, and to every other point of recent introduction . Unless, perhaps, in the case of some few spirited individuals, things remain as they have done, and will probably continue to do so until the expiration of their occupation arrives.” — Mark Lane Express, February 16, 1857.

# ESSENTIAL PRELIMINARIES TO PROFITABLE FARMING.
* A thorough knowledge of your business, practical and theoretical.
* Ability to buy in the cheapest, and sell in the dearest market.
* To select the most able workmen of industrious and honest habits.
* To choose as your Bailiff a man of forethought, integrity, and firmness, combined with great industry and keen perceptive powers.
* To apportion rightly your land and capital.
* To maintain in economical efficiency the motive power, whether horse or steam.
* Deep , frequent, and clean cultivation .
* Drainage of land not naturally filtrative .
* Shelter for stock.
* Efficientmachinery and farm implements.
* Ample use of purchased food and manures.
* Rigidly correct farm accounts, posted daily from the cash book and journal.
* Estimates of the cost and return of each crop in detail.

There has been so general an impression that my farming was my hobby for amusement, and not for profit, that I purpose to dispel what remains of this prejudice by a practical investigation of farm practice in a pecuniary point of view.
THE REAL TEST OF ECONOMY is the cost price per quarter, per ton , or per lb ., of the produce of the farm . The poor unimproving farmer is generally the producer of the dearest and most unremunerating food , whereas, on the contrary, the man who spendsmost per acre, and pays the highest cent, is the cheapest producer ; therefore, I always ask what does your corn cost you per quarter ? not what do you spend per acre.

Let me illustrate this from actual facts.

I quote this particular crop because I have watched it this year in comparison with my own, but we may carry out the comparison in almost all the others. 

In these cases THE RUIN IS PRINCIPALLY CAUSED BY NON -DRAINAGE, for the more you disturb and pulverize undrained heavy land in fine dry weather, the more close and miry it will become during the rains of winter. There being no drains under it, the water accumulates and stagnates until the spring and summer, its only escape being upwards as steam, so that the heat of the sun is literally employed in evaporating the water instead of stimulating the plant to do this. The result of all this is, that such seeds as escape bursting and freezing in the mire of winter, vegetate slowly; the roots refusing to go into stagnant air and stagnant water, there is but little root formation, and consequently a miserably deficient surface growth, and an unprofitable crop; contrast this with the drained land — there the roots roam freely and deeply, producing vigorous and branching shoots with broad and numerous leaves, passing through the plant under the influence of summer rays an immense amount of fluidity, the result of such elaboration being an abundant crop . The knowledge of vegetable physiology teaches us the value of drainage. A tree or plant will avoid stagnant water, but will seek out and multiply its roots in a running stream , the latter having a constant supply of fresh air. Water kept in motion becomes aerated. A small can of live fish in a gig or coach would travel from John O 'Groat's to the Land's End without injury, the water being in constant agitation , but stand the can quietly on a table for 15 minutes and the fish would die , there being no change of air ; roots of plants require change of air as much as fish or animals. Every shower on drained land leaves, by percolation and filtration , a new air and new fertility ; besides, it is well known that plants having one root in moisture, as in deeply drained soils, will bring up to the
dry surface, and diffuse by its other roots a healthy humidity ; and I suppose that it is the deep rootedness of Mangel Wurzel that gives it, in our dry Eastern Counties, such a power of resisting drought.

It is impossible to travel through the various districts of this kingdom without coming to the sad conclusion that BAD FARMING IS THE RULE, AND GOOD FARMING THE EXCEPTION , and that the bulk of the land is farmed in the least profitable manner. There are many causes for this, such as the poverty of landlords, the over -holding of tenants in proportion to their capital, the want of tenant valuations, or leases, but the greatest and most fatal cause is the comfortable belief in and self-satisfaction with the present state of farm practice . This remark applies equally to land lords and tenants.

I am aware that for many years a belief was entertained by agriculturists that Mr. Mechi was a visionary enthusiast, but I have seen enough to convince me that it would be happy for the bulk of our heavy land agriculturists, if they could raise their produce at as low a cost as I do mine.

Living, as I do, in a district capable of immense progress, I am enabled to arrive at exact comparative results, and I have no hesitation in saying that the majority of heavy land farmers would be in a far more advantageous position if they had to pay £2 to £3 more per acre for the advantages I have named.

In fact, the difference in my produce and that of many others is from £5 to £10 per acre - I mean at the recent liberal prices.

The great wants of our stiff clays are drainage, more manure, deeper cultivation, and covered yards for stock . I have watched attentively the most money-making farmers, and I find that they are those who practise as I have described.

The want of drainage on clays is ruinous. I have seen a clean summer fallow made on such land, and the whole in beautiful tilth , but what follows ? the rains of autumn and winter are absorbed and retained for want of filtration , and the fallow becomes a sea of mud, saturating, swelling, and rotting much of the seed, rendering the land most difficult and expensive to operate upon, and in the spring baking hard and cracking like the mud bottom of a drained pond ; the wretched and spindled plants struggle for an existence and produce a miserable result. I have seen such fields adjoin my own, where the difference has been £10 per acre , principally owing to the absence of drainage.

You may alwaysknow undrained heavy land in dry weather, it is hard and knobby. The only seasons that suit the undrained heavy clays of England, are a dry spring and a very hot summer. The wide and deep cracks answer the purpose of drainage to some extent, by an enormous and deep evaporation, but a wet spring is the ruin of such soils ; and yet it is still difficult to make farmers believe that water will filtrate readily through the strongest clays to the drains.

The very best drainage in such soils would not cost more than £6 to £7 per acre, and I am sure that the loss arising from their absence has, in too many instances , been equal to the whole cost of the drainage in a single year. I am speaking now of Wheat at 60s. per quarter, or Oats at 28s. per quarter.

The question is not a disputable one, as the facts are patent wherever two adjoining fields are drained and undrained . I have watched the question closely during the last fifteen years, when I first drained my heavy soil.

In many seasons, a farmer who paid 9s ., or 71 per cent. on £6 per acre drainage, would find a difference of at least £5 in his corn crop ; and still the great bulk of the heavy lands of England remain undrained ! ! ! I believe at least 50 millions of money might be immediately and most advantageously so employed ; it would add immensely to our home supply of
food. The advantages of drainage have been so often and so largely explained by myself and others, that I will not dwell upon them.

The next important question is SHELTER FOR STOCK. On clay farms your animals seldom do well on the land after October, and even if the weather is sufficiently favorable to permit their feeding , they should during the long nights be comfortably housed and lie dry. To do this in a permanent manner would cost, at 5 per cent., an annual charge of ls. 6d. per annum per sheep , or 12s. per annum for a bullock . Now, I have no hesitation in saying that it makes more than 1d.
per sheep per week difference during the 18 winter weeks, or, in other words, 3 lbs. ofmutton at 6d. per lb.

It is notorious that during wet and frosty weather whole fields of turnips have been consumed without making 1 lb. of mutton, but it is easy to understand this by looking at the poor sheep at break of day, after lying for 14 dark hours on a wet, cold soil , which absorbs the heat of their bodies, whilst their soaked and frosted fleeces complete their misery. The loss of sheep, by death, would pay for the shed -room . The value of a single sheep at 40s. would pay for the shelter of 480 sheep for one week . Practically , I have not lost one sheep per year on the average of the last 15 years, although I fat 300 to 400 annually.

The next important consideration is THE QUANTITY OF MEAT MADE ON A FARM PER ACRE, for in proportion to this will be the quantity of corn grown.

By asking a few questions of a farmer I can almost immediately arrive at a conclusion as to his position, without visiting his farm . The first question would be “ how much meat do you make per acre, over the whole acreage of your farm ?” This question has been solved by Mr. Thomas Dyke Acland , in the Royal Agricultural Society's Journal, vol. 11, page 666. There it will be seen that the largest corn - growing farmer in Norfolk , a most successful man , produces 44 score ofmeat on every acre of his land ; compare this with the general average of the farms of this kingdom , which certainly do not produce one score lbs. of meat per acre . The more meat you make the more manure you produce, and the more corn you grow . The common labourer is the best evidence on this point, with his one-eighth of an acre of ground he knows that unless he keeps a pig to make manure, he cannot expect a crop. Therefore, he fats one pig, which consumes three sacks, or twelve bushels of barley -meal, which , at 7 lbs. ofmeal to 1 lb . of meat, would be 84 lbs. ofmeat, or four score on the one eighth of an acre, or over 32 score per acre.

It has often been remarked that, amidstmiserable land and wretched farming, the labourer's cottage-garden is like an oasis in the desert ; but when I shew that independent of deeper cultivation , it receives in manure 32 times the farmer's quantity, the contrast need no longer be a matter of surprise. Of course the farmer who makes the largest quantity of meat obtains a proportionate amount ofmanure, and of produce.

Some years ago, when good Danish barley could be had for 19s. per quarter, I fattened an immense quantity of pork and other meat, equal to at least 20 score per acre. The farm has never forgotten it, and as I made so much manure when corn was cheap , I have been enabled to grow large crops during the late high prices; thus justifying the calculations I made in my celebrated balance sheet. I seldom make less than 10 to 13 score lbs. of meat per acre over the whole farm; it is the key to good crops.

Assuming that 7 lbs. of beans or oil-cake will make 1 lb . of mutton , IT WOULD PAY A FARMER WELL TO SELL HIS BEANS TO HIS SHEEP at 40s. per quarter, because that price is about one penny per pound, and mutton at 7d. per lb . would pay for seven pounds of beans. The beans thus remain on the farm ; but, even supposing that you give to your sheep four quarters of beans per acre, and that you lose 10 per cent. by them , or 16s. per acre, I am prepared to prove that in the corn crop that follows the increase will be at least £3 per acre beyond the sum that would otherwise be realized.

I know a farmer, within a few miles of me, who always allows his 1,500 fattening sheep 1 lb . of beans per diem
when feeding in the field ; the consequence is a general and progressive enrichment of the soil, which almost compels him to take an extra corn crop to tame the land. In my own case I generally on one field , annually, which has become saucy , take five or six quarters of Rivett wheat per acre after a similar crop of ordinary wheat. The farmer to whom I allude takes green rye after oats, rye fed off with sheep eating beans, then turnips, put into little mounds, and fed off in February and March with sheep eating beans, then barley with seed , then clover once mowed, and then fed off with sheep eating beans, then wheat followed by oats, which com pletes the rotation - thus growing three corn crops, one root crop, and two green crops in a course of five years, with an increasing fertility . The fact is, the poverty- stricken prin cipleof a lot of hungry, half-starved sheep growing into money, and exhausting the land , is a miserable and ruinous plan, and the time will come when our Welch and Irish friends will fat more at home, rather than supply us with the heart of their land in the shape of lean stock.

There are certain fixed expenses on land, whether we grow a large crop or a poor one - rent, tithe, taxes, manual and horse labour, and seed, become a very heavy per centage of charge on a minimum crop, whilst on a maximum one the expenses are proportionately diminished . On well laid out land, with few fences, good drainage, and good roads, there is actually much less cost of labour than on a poor, undrained farm , with wide and irregular hedges, green lanes, and choked -up ditches ; as most ofmy work is done by piece, I can estimate the difference with accuracy.

# EVILS OF OVER-SEEDING .

One of the crying evils of the day is the over quantity of seed drilled.

In former times , when broad -casting was the practice, many seeds never vegetated, but now , with the accuracy of deposit by drills, a much smaller quantity is required , and the system of high farming positively demands a reduced quantity of seed , otherwise the crops run up densely, and are laid prematurely. This remark applies particularly to barley after turnips, fed off with oil cake. Myusual quantity of seed per acre is

* Wheat, 1 bushel;
* Barley, 6 to 8 pecks ;
* Oats , 2 bushels ;

and I feel that, with high cultivation , I still sow too thickly.

It may be said – why, if we manure so highly , we shall get our crops ruined. I reply, who ever heard of over-manuring for a root, a green , or a pulse crop ? Plough your manure in deeper, mix with it more of the subsoil, and follow , if you can , the example of our market gardeners. The fact is , that, looking the country through, WE DO NOT HALF MANURE OR CULTIVATE FOR OUR ROOT CROPS . I remember once saving £5 on a root crop, and lost, in con sequence, 13 tons of mangel wurzel, which I was then sell ing at £l per ton . The field , only dug one spit and once manured , produced 30 tons per acre ; the other, double dug and twice manured, grew 43 tons. But see what a difference is felt in the subsequent corn and other crops. The effects are spread over many years. I am convinced that, for rapid summer growth , the manure should have reached the subsoil, either by solution or admixture, for during the dry, hot months the roots go down deeply in search of moisture , and there they ought to find their food — the manure. All these statements of mine are as easily ascertainable and provable on a perch of ground, as on a thousand acres, therefore, I say , don't disbelieve, but try them.

I have often watched a corn and root crop, and so long as their roots only occupy the ploughed and manured surface, all goes on prosperously , but when in stronger and later growth they search the subsoil, then is the time to judge by their looks, whether they are luxuriating in manure and aeration, or whether they have to contend against the too common evils of a stagnated and unaerated soil — unmanured, uncultivated, and undrained. The bilious and disappointed crop gives un mistakeable evidence of its condition, and ends in an unprofitable result.

# THE COST OF IMPROVEMENT.

As a general estimate, you cannot effectually improve stiff land under £25 per acre, or,with buildings, £30 per acre ; your drainage will cost you £6 per acre ; fallowing, levelling , sub soiling, & c., £7, and a good heavy manuring £7 ; lime or chalk £5 ; then comes the question - Are you not better off, having to pay 10 per cent., or £2 to £3 per acre extra, than if these improvements were not made. I have no hesitation in saying that the difference is more often £6 per acre than £2. What a miserable miscalculation , then , not to make these amendments. Your sowings and harvestings become earlier and cheaper, your horse and manual labour less , and the tout ensemble one of prosperity in lieu of adversity. Covered yards are cheaper than the ordinary homesteads, and can be effected completely for £5 to £7 per acre, a profit able investment at 5 per cent. for the tenant.

# EDUCATION

I have often alluded to the inconvenience, in a business point of view , of educational ignorance. I say educational, because the Almighty alone gives mind ; man can only culti vate it ; but many of my best workmen cannot read and write, and it is a drawback to their otherwise intelligent minds. It is true we have now a subscription school, but until the last two years there were little , if any, means of education for a parish of 5 ,000 acres , with a population of near 1, 500 people. It is a painful truth that a large number of farmers, uneducated themselves, are not sufficiently alive to the great advantages afforded by education. Rates to keep in repair the highways are readily granted, but the minds that are to direct the future farm operations of this kingdom remain unmended and uncared for, except by the unfair taxation of the benevolent.

# MANAGEMENT OF ESTATES

The contrasts in the managementof estates in this kingdom are as great as those in our farming. In some which I have had the privilege of inspecting (such as the Duke of Bedford 's, the Duke of Richmond's, Lord Hatherton 's, Lord Willoughby D 'Eresby 's, Earl Bathurst's, Lord Radnor's, Earl Fortescue's, & c., & c .) a judicious and continuous expenditure of a portion of the annual rental, has tended greatly to augment that rental, besides producing food and employment for an increasing population . But beyond all this the care for the physical and consequent moral condition of the labourer, by a system of proper and decent cottage accommodation, and garden allotment, exhibit a sagacious recognition and appreciation of the bonds that tie so strongly together the various classes of our happy community.

But, as I said in farming, these are the exceptions, and not the rule, and I see too often , with sorrow and disgust, the opposite of all this. No annual appropriation for improvement or profit, but a dilapidatory and depressing influence extending its baneful influence to every interest on the estate.

The power of an individual to influence and stimulate pro gression in his own immediate neighbourhood is often very effective and considerable, and, to a certain extent, it may be admitted that good tenants may be created or bred on the estate, having before them the example of a noble-minded and judicious proprietor who combines progress with profit.

Probably the Lincolnshire system of valuations ensures most permanently high farming as a system . It should never be forgotten that improvements create a new and extended market for our own agricultural produce.

# MANAGEMENT OF STIFF CLAYS

In dealing with a stiff clay farm , deficient in buildings or shelter for stock , I should depend almost entirely on green crops that could be spring and summer fed , plenty of tares, clover, and rape. The mangel not to be commenced until March or April. Beans to be well manured, and thoroughly cleaned, and then consumed on the farm . As a general rule, I grow one-eighth beans, one-eighth clover , one- eighth tares, one-eighth mangel, the rest corn , thus making the rotation once in eight years.

As a golden rule , never omit ploughing or digging your land before the last frost. One night's frost will do more cultivation than all theharrows and rolls. Of course all your stubbles will be scarified during the hot month of September , when 24 hours' sunshine in our county will perish every weed.

Nothing is easier than working a heavy land drained farm if you watch your opportunity, and avoid spring ploughing

# CROSSKILL'S ROLLER

If you do plough up deeply in the spring any of your stiff clay subsoil you will find that it dries hard and unmanageable. Crosskill's roller (with five cwt. added behind to balance the shafts,) will crack the clods, which then again dry , and after another scarifying, another clod - crushing or two will so open and expose the hitherto hermetically sealed soil, that it is easily pulverized by the first shower, and if you have previously top-dressed it with lime it will become in a useful and sweet condition . Land, so Crosskilled, does not bind during summer - of course I speak of drained clays. Fine cultivation is the rain of undrained clays , - I wish there werenone left.

# PROFITS IN AGRICULTURE

Let him who enters on farming make up his mind to great vicissitudes in price , and in some degree in quantity and quality. It is the history of the past, and will be of the future . If the average is remunerative it is all we can expect. The historical ups and downs of agriculture are interesting and forewarning, — they may easily be obtained if desired.

# THE CONDITION OF MY SOIL 

Although my land for ten years was cropped every other year with wheat, and although it is in other respects “ very hard worked,” yet its fertility has every year increased. My old Bailiff complainingly exclaims “ that guano does no good now - you cannot see where it goes," whilst 14 years ago the smallest dusting of it shewed a marked effect. He cannot be made to understand that the land was then un drained and full of poverty , ( like too much now in our neigh bourhood), whereas now drainage, cultivation, and plenty of manure from stock have filled it with an enduring fertility , which renders the action of guano comparatively inoperative. Three years ago I bought a field adjoining my own , and on putting down the fence mymen could hardly believe thatmy own land could ever have been like that, so cold and be numbed , full of weak stubble, and poverty -stricken weeds. The tread was entirely different. These contrasts afford encouraging reflections for an agricultural improver.

# MY CROPS

The average yield of my crops for several years has been wheat, over 5 quarters ; barley, 7 quarters ; oats, 11 quarters ; and other things in proportion . My mangel wurzel are always good, varying from 25 to 40 tons per acre. In our dry climate , in Essex, these roots are more certain as a crop than swedes, which prefer a moister climate and a looser soil.

# FARM LABOURERS

will not be troublesome to manage, if they know that you or your Bailiff know what a fair day's work is ; without this knowledge you will be. unfavourably placed. I prefer piece , or task work , with steady dependable men . As my labour, including engineer, & c., costs me 45s. per acre, a mistake of 10 per cent. would add 4s . 6d. per acre to my rental.

# BUYING AND SELLING

If you buy ó per cent. too dear, and sell 5 per cent. too cheap , your farming profit is gone. Bear in mind that there are in every market men who are keen and thorough judges of the value of every article . If you are not so, you must find some good judge to act for you, otherwise you will soon fall a victim to superior power. The amount of fleecing from the inexperienced is something surprising in amount. I have known an animal bought cheaply, change hands several times in an hour, and afford a good profit at each change, excepting, perhaps, the last

# LIGHT LANDS

Anybody with ordinary brains may farm light naturally drained land , cover it with sheep eating rape-cake, oil-cake, or beans, or some of each . Let your corn crops get well rooted before the frost comes. Use Crosskill or the drill presser, and use plenty of artificials for your root crops. If you are troubled with wire -worm , never sow your corn crop without rape dust, four to five cwt. per acre, it will pay in the crop, especially if you use a little salt with it . Super phosphate of lime suits many light lands ; on my clays it never shews the least result, proving, I suppose, that I have already in the land , or by my feeding, quite as much as the crops require . Claying or marling light soils pays well.

# REAPING MACHINES

A wise farmer will use a reaping machine. I have done so for several years ; I never had any trouble with mine, because I lent it to my men , and they soon found it was to their advantage to keep it in perfect working order The great economy is time, which it certainly saves in harvest

# WAGGONS

on our farm would be considered by the men themselves as antiquated and obstructive inconveniencies. They would in crease the expenses, and delay the time of harvest materially. For 14 years we have used Hannam 's one-horse skeleton carts. (See Royal Agricultural Society 's Journal, vol. 2 , page 73.)

# COMPARATIVE MERITS OF CORN AND CAKE

A farmer, whom I knew , divided a field of rape - half was fed off with sheep eating barley, and half with sheep eating an equal value of oil-cake ; the difference in the subsequent crop of barley was two quarters more after the cake, than after the barley. This is consistent with chemical analysis, the cake containing nearly twice as much nitrogen and phosphate. Nobody will be ever ruined by using plenty of rape-cake, either for feeding or for manure ; you may always see the results in the following crop. I have used 100 tons ; it contains quite as much manurial element as oil-cake, and costs much less money . I never saw a sheep that would not eat it. I have fattened some thousands on it . When sheep are on clover, giving them rape-cake and locusts will make them fatten most rapidly , and the mutton is peculiarly rich and palatable . They are wonderfully fond of the locusts, and will, if you permit them , eat a large quantity . When they know the locusts are in the troughs, they will race to the fold to be first, not so when there is only rape-cake. They are more fond of linseed - cake than rape-cake. As a general rule , I think 7 lbs . of rape-cake, linseed -cake, or beans, will make 1 lb . of net mutton . If so, you get the manure for nothing, when a pound of mutton is worth as much as 7 lbs. of either rape- cake, linseed - cake, or beans. This is cheaper manure than any you can buy at any price . Seven lbs . of barley will make 1 lb . of pork.


# FARM HORSES

Enquire in your neighbourhood how many horses have died on a given number of acres during the last seven years , and you will be astonished at the gross total thus abstracted annually from the capital of agriculture; much of this loss arises from mismanagement. Animals are allowed to gorge themselves with masses of indigestible green food, which fer ments, generates gases, and produces swelling , inflammation, and death . Again , horses coming in heated are allowed to drink cold water ad libitum , producing gripes, surfeit, & c . It is notorious that brewers' horses drink when they please, but then their water is always warm , and no evil result takes place.

Another common cause of disease is want of ventilation in stables, hence a putrescent atmosphere , producing farcy and many other diseases . Our London horses, well housed , groomed , and fed on comminuted food, contrast strangely with the usual listless, pot-bellied farm horses , with undeveloped fore and hind quarters , and uncombed manes and tails . Is it not possible for agriculture not to be slovenly ? Great losses also occur amongst cattle, & c., for want of due attention to the commixing and dividing their food. Turning animals into green food , when the hoar frost is on it, causes abundant deaths.

# MANGEL WURZEL FOR HORSES

I seldom give my horses any hay ; they get two bushels per week of crushed oats, plenty of fine cut and sifted wheat straw , or oat- straw , and 20 to 30 lbs. of mangel wurzel per day ; their condition is first-rate. The mangel is a perfect substitute for hay, and keeps the horses in excellent health . The mangel may be used immediately after being pulled, provided there is plenty of dry chaff with it. There is no reason why mangel should not fatten horses as well as bullocks and sheep. I know a very extensive farmer in Suffolk who uses mangel on a large scale for his horses, and finds it a great economy as compared with hay. The mangel are cleaned from any soil, and thrown whole into the manger.

# PIGS

Few people have fattened more pigs than myself, or more successfully. Cooking meal for pigs in cold weather is desirable , but I have always depended on summer fattening as the most profitable, the carbon of the food going to make fat instead of heat. In winter, pigs having no wool, are not so profitable to fatten , sheep do better then. Of course the price of corn and pork must be considered — when a lb . of pork is worth seven lbs. weight of barley, or peas, you may safely go largely into fattening.

I have had 300 to 400 pigs at one time for several years , and never had disease, but if you litter them on straw , and have many, they will get heaves, or lung disease. 

Mine have been on open sparred floors, so that air always circulated under and around them , and the atmosphere did not become putrescent, which is almost sure to take place on straw , especially if soft or barley straw . 

Good strong reedy wheat straw , frequently changed , is a good thing, because the air circulates under the animals amongst the straw , but there is nothing like boards. Beans alone, and lentils alone, will give pigs cramp when confined. If soaked 24 hours before giving them , I am told they will not do so . 

I knew a farmer who manured his grass land by sowing every day so much land with beans broadcast. 

The pigs were turned in , and regularly picked up every bean, and manured the land so sown. By repeating this daily he regularly manured all his field . This is cheaper than the dung cart. It is the filling, carting, turning over , re- filling, carting, and spreading, and wasting, that run away with the
farmer's profit. 

Nothing like the sheep-fold or pig -fold ; washing the manure away by buildings' water is absolute ruin .

#IRON AS MANURE
## FALLOW

A farmer once told me he manured his land with iron, and explained that it was the plough which furnished his manure. This is literally true, for so many ploughings , harrowings, scarifyings, Crosskillings, & c., in a summer will fill your heavy land with fertility, provided the inorganics are there . There is a love between the air and the soil, which ends in a . fructifying attachment if you will but expose them to each other's influence . This is thoroughly understood in the Rodings of Essex, where the crop and fallow system have existed for ages. A farmer is sure of his crop of barley after a long fallow .

No such result would occur did we plough about so many billiard or bagatelle balls.

I knew a farmer who took a good farm wretchedly out of condition and full of weeds. He fallowed every acre of it, taking care to allow time between each ploughing for the vegetation of the seed weeds. The result was à crop of wheat, averaging 5 quarters per acre, and other crops in proportion . He was a wise man .

In our eastern and southern counties weeds are far more easily destroyed than in Devonshire and other hilly and moist districts. Our burning and drying sunshine gives us cereal advantages, but we suffer in our turnips and grasses, except where we can get irrigation .

I believe that in our stiff clays we have a great store of mineral manures, in what Dr. Daubeney justly calls a passive condition . Drainage, aeration by cultivation , lime and clay burning, bring them into active disintegration and use. I am a great believer in Liebig's mineral theory, and, therefore, respect the alkalies of the stiff soils. The great secret is to keep such soils open and aerated .

# ITALIAN RYE GRASS
I sow this with the seed barrow on the barley about May, when the barley is sufficiently grown to merely permit the germination of the seed . As soon as the barley is harvested the rye grass begins to show itself. It then requires a good irrigation of liquefied manure . In the warm growing season you cannot give it too much moisture. Without this, after the first cutting there will be no crop. After its second year it is ploughed and followed by peas or beans, or turnips, never by a cereal crop.

Its value, as an early spring feed , is too well known to require comment. Land can never be too highly farmed for Italian rye grass , I often cut it or feed it four or five times during the season .

# BEANS
I am very fond of beans on heavy land . You cannot over manure for them , and they are a capital preparation for wheat. We generally drill in February , harrow them when an inch high, horse-hoe them well, and hand -hoe them twice, and then the land, after harvesting, will be as clean as a garden . I grow an eighth of my heavy land in beans annually .

# WEEDS
The growth of weeds costs Great Britain millions annually . From the 20th ofMay until the end of June all the mischief is done, for, if previously neglected, the rush of vegetation at that period in the South of England renders eradication hopeless. Of course in root crops there is no excuse for growing weeds. As you cannot always get manual labour enough at the critical period, it is both cheaper and more effective to use Garrett's horse-hoe, which has been my mainstay in this respect for many years, all my drilled corn crops being cleaned by it between the rows. As soon as the corn crops are removed the stubbles should be scarified, or the weeds will prosper. Our yellow clays produce black grass, which vegetates in October and November. It is highly desirable to harrow this up ere you sow your wheat, or it will give you much trouble

# ADVANTAGE OF DEEP CULTIVATION
This is particularly shown immediately over the drains where the earth has been deeply disturbed ; many people fancy that it is because it drains quicker, but the truth is that air has more ready access to the soil. Wherever a loaded cart-wheel consolidates the soil in wet weather, the ensuing crop does not prosper, especially barley and turnips, but wheat and beans have a greater power of penetrating strong soils .

# TOWN AND HOUSE SEWAGE
Before the year 1957 the people of this country will have come to their senses on the value of this substance, which is literally their food  but there will be an immense extent of discussion, doubt, and disbelief, all which can alone be removed by time and necessity . Already the screw is put on guano, or birds' dung, will soon be as dear as rappee, or, perhaps, unobtainable, and then the British public will naturally enquire whether their own dung is not superior to that of birds. My own experience and opinions have been long since recorded ( 1843) and a few years' application of liquified manure to my farm has satisfied me how easy and profitable an operation it is to re-apply that which was taken from the land.

It is a remarkable and rather odd inconsistency, that whilst we are about purifying the Thames near London , and taking our drinking water from the neighbourhood of Hampton , that all the way up the Thames and its tributaries, the various towns situated on and near their banks are , under the new Board of Health Act, now discharging all their sewage into the very stream that we are endeavouring to purify.

# THE VALUE OF GREEN AND ROOT CROPS.

There is nothing that puzzles an inexperienced agriculturist more than this question. If you graze, and do not breed stock , you will have occasionally to pay very high prices for your lean animals. At this moment, March, 1857, you cannot buy lean sheep under 7s. per stone of 8 lbs. (net dead weight), whilst the price of fat sheep is only 6s. per stone ; so that probably those who purchase lean stock now will have to give away their root and green crops without return , except the manure, or at the end of 16 weeks sell the same sheep , fat, at no greater price than they now cost lean. In this instance the breeder has the advantage, at other times the reverse of this takes place.

On the whole, perhaps, there is no better average plan than breeding a portion of your stock, if the farm is suitable for it. Some years your root and green crops will realize, in meat, £7 to £8 per acre, at other times possibly not so much as a tithe of that sum . Turnips that cost £7 or £8 per acre are often let for feeding at £l per acre , the owner of the sheep giving them } lb . of oil-cake per day. I have known that many acres of roots and green crops have been given for the purpose of sheep feeding,where farmers are deficient in capital. As a general rule, where much purchased food is used, a con siderable loss or charge is incurred for the manure, but still it is the best and cheapest way of obtaining it.

If you are unfortunate in the health of your stock , then the loss is serious indeed . A long experience has taught me that pigs lose less money than any other stock. Seeing that manure is so costly to produce , the waste of it is, indeed, an agricultural criminality

Animals that are fed on hay, linseed-cake,and roots, seldom leavemuch price for the roots after paying for the hay and cake - leaving no margin for casualties, attendance, or shelter.

Mr. Lawes has shown beyond a doubt, in the Royal Agricultural Society 's Journal, that there is no way of obtaining manure so cheaply as by feeding animals. Ofcourse that system involves a larger capital per acre, inasmuch as we must keep more stock and employ more labour, but common calculation will enable a farmer who knows the chemical analyses of each feeding stuff and its market price to avail of opportunities.

For instance , beans are now about three farthings a pound, and mutton sevenpence-halfpenny. Now , if seven pounds of beans will make one pound of mutton, it is quite clear that you get your manure for nothing. Of course , I do not mean that sheep should have nothing but beans. Take pork , and, at the present falling prices of peas and beans, manure might be, through pigs, cheaply obtained.

1500 sheep folded on an acre of land for twenty four hours (or 100 sheep 15 days ) would manure that land sufficiently to carry it through a four years' rotation . Now , if each sheep had one pound of beans, or three quarters per acre, it would tend greatly to fertility , and leave no immediate loss .

This system is the way to increase the fertility of your soil at the least possible expense, and it is the absence of this practice that I complain of as being so injurious to all classes, but particularly to the farmer himself. I may be told — but where is the money to come from ? I answer, that country bankers are but too happy to assist prudent, thriving, farmers - next to depositors, they are their best customers, because the improvements they make, being very profitable, enable them to pay a good interest for the money they borrow.

In order to make 14 score lbs. of meat per acre, it would be necessary to have 20 score lbs. of lean stock per acre. This and the feeding would involve a capital in live stock and food alone of some £10 to £15 per acre.

# ARTIFICIAL MANURES
I know a farmer with 600 acres, who says that if he spends £l per acre, in artificial manures, his farm pays ; if not, it loses. I know some who spend double that sum . I have only placed 10s. per acre for artificial manure because I pro uce much manure by feeding animals , which , if there is capital, is the cheapest way of getting genuine manure.

# MANAGEMENT
This is a comprehensive term ; it implies the right man in the right place, and the right thing done at the right time. In every undertaking, warlike or peaceful, it is alike essential, but particularly so in agriculture, where the fluctuations in weather render forethought and promptitude an essentiality for profit. For instance, take the question of Drilling, — you find a particular day or two when your heavy land is neither too wet nor too dry, but friable and lively — to lose such an opportunity would indeed be a loss.
Again , in wet weather a frost may form a thin crust, through which your drill will work pleasantly, and your harrows finish up ; it is an occasion not to be passed over. Again , in October we have an average of 21 fine days - off with your Mangel Wurzel. In November, wet and fogs— woe be to your land, roads, and horses if you get caught. Begin your harvest a little too soon , you will find in a couple of days that all your corn has come on surprisingly. It is true reaping machines will make shorter and more certain work of our harvesting. In business matters it is desirable to make one's feelings subserve to one's interest. Good-natured people are apt to keep on incompetent persons for old acquaintance sake, – I have suffered somewhat myself occasionally from such a sentiment.

# STOCK - TAKING
Book-keeping is as necessary on a farm as in a warehouse. How can we tell what each kind of live stock pays or loses, unless their value is taken once a year, and the quantity and value of food consumed, and of stock bought or sold , duly registered ? If you buy and sell for cash , your cash -book will contain every item paid or received . From this you can post to every account. I use Swinborne's Farm Book, published at Colchester. It is by a rigid investigation of the cost and return of each particular crop that we detect the weak points in agriculture, and find out how to correct them . 

# FARM EXPENDITURE
In making out the expenses attached to each crop, I have found it necessary to distribute to each a charge of £1. 2s. 6d. for a number of miscellaneous items as per list, and also to add the sum of £1. 5s. on each acre for labour in yard , attending on live stock , for horse and manual labour of a miscellaneous and undefinable character, and for extra quan tities of manure. I have been minutely particular in estimating every item of expenditure, and which , diffused over the whole area , gives a charge of £7. 178. 2d. per acre, — all beyond this realized by the crops will be interest or profit on capital invested . For want of a remembrancer in detail of all charges, many are apt to take too favourable a view of farming, and thus lose their money, and become disgusted with the occupation .

# MY PRICES FOR FIELD OPERATIONS.
As there is an erroneous supposition that I pay fancy prices for mywork, I annex a list ofwhat I pay, and imagine it will make some of mypractical friends scratch their heads. The fact is,with a well-trained staff of regularly employed agricul tural labourers, who have been through the whole process of modern improvements, you may always do work on the easiest terms; themen are so “ handy," and there is scarcely one on my farm who could not work my steam engine. Besides, with light carts, good roads, and easy access to every part of the farm , you may safely compete with the most pinching screw , who is surrounded by green muddy lanes, small fields, and badly placed buildings.
I am very fond of digging or rather forking a few acres every November , say about six to eight acres, for mangel. It pays well. When labour was cheap, I used to pay 2d. per rod, or 26s. 8d . per acre; but now I pay 3d. per rod, or £2 per acre. Some farmers seem quite astonished at my working my 170 acres of heavy land, all arable, with five horses, with an occasional additional horse ; but steam is a great help .

or £6. 10s. 6d. per acre per annum .

On some very poor land I have kept 16.5 sheep per acre during six summer months. Some portion is mowed off , but I generally consumemuch of it with sheep on the land eating rape- cake or beans. After two years' such treatment the land is in first-rate condition for beans or root crops, and after that for corn.

Much more manure may be put on, such as rape-cake, guano, & c . Of course that would have to be charged, and would be returned in the increased produce.

As a general rule, you cannot over -manure for Italian rye grass, provided it is administered in a liquid state , or washed in by rain .

Take my own case as an illustration of the principle which I am endeavouring to enforce. The original rental of my farm was a little over 20s. per acre. It is now more than double that sum , the excess being interest on improvements ; now instead of £l per acre difference in the crops as compared with what they used to be , 14 years' experience has taught me that the difference is from 3 to £5 per acre, and in some crops £7 to £9 per acre. The average yield of the crops now and before the improvements may be represented ás five to three at the very least. On comparing notes with an intelligent neigbour of mine, he admitted that my extra expenses of £2 per acre, as compared with his , were more than compensated in my increased crops .

## CONCLUSION
In conclusion, if I find a heavy land farm properly drained, free from unnecessary fences, with good covered yards, cent rally placed, and proper and modern machinery ; if I find it free from weeds, and, above all, if I know that on that arable farm at least 200 lbs. weight of meat is made per acre per annum , the result must be a certain profit. Nothing can prevent this but gross mismanagement or ignorance of the business. But how few such farms does merry England exhibit ! Truth replies how few ! ! !

All my life it has been my habit, in order to arrive at truth , to examine and compare various systems, with a view to form a judgment on the facts. I am quite satisfied that the mass of mankind do not adopt my practice, else it would be impossible that such miserable and unprofitable discrepancies could exist in agriculture. There are none so blind as those who will not see, and if self-interest will not prompt our landlords and tenants mutually to improve, nothing that I can say can have that desirable effect
